Prerequisites:
AWS Account: You need an AWS account.
AWS CLI: Install and configure the AWS CLI with your credentials (aws configure).
EB CLI: Install the Elastic Beanstalk CLI.
Python & Pip: Ensure you have Python 3.8+ and pip installed locally.
Git: EB CLI often uses git for tracking application versions (though not strictly required for simple zip uploads). It's good practice to have your project in a git repository (git init, git add ., git commit -m "Initial commit").
